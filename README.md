## Express.js Unhandled Promise Rejection Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections.  In this scenario, an asynchronous operation within a route handler might throw an error, but the error handling is incomplete, leading to a silent failure or unexpected application behavior.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

### How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Observe the console output and the application's behavior.  The application might crash unexpectedly or simply fail silently.
5. Now run `node bugSolution.js` and see the difference.

### Solution

The solution involves using proper error handling within the `.catch()` block of your promises to gracefully handle errors and potentially send appropriate error responses to the client.
